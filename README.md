# ProCompete
The concept of 'ProCompete' is to let a user take quiz in a category of his choice. This lets the user take the quiz in a very attractive manner. The user is able to track his performance and analyze the quiz on its completion. The application requires the user to sign in using Google or Facebook authentication; this creates a unique reference of the user with respect to the type of authentication inside the database. This data about the user is used to save the categories of questions that the user selects to take quiz on so that he can take quiz on the same topic again in the future without having to select that category again from the list of available categories. Another advantage of this scheme is that even if the user uninstalls the application, still on reinstallation, user data is retained. This application also has the feature to send notifications to the users which let us communicate with the users in a very effective manner.
